## Material and Mouse driven theme for [AwesomeWM 4.3](https://awesomewm.org/)
### Original work by PapyElGringo, official development seem to have moved to [material-shell](https://github.com/PapyElGringo/material-shell)

This fork will eventually become a fully fledged desktop environment. Initially, I will focus on reworking the workspace management system and application launching configuration. 

A desktop environment made with [AwesomeWM](https://awesomewm.org/) following the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io) with a performant opiniated mouse/keyboard workflow to increase daily productivity and comfort.

Note: This is nowhere near ready to be used. If you simply want a config for AwesomeWM, please use the project from https://github.com/HikariKnight/material-awesome or https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/material-awesome. Thank you.
